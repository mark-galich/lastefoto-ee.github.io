Hi! I'm Viktoria a newborn and child photographer in Tallinn, Estonia.

Together we could create an unique **history of _your_ family ❤️**

Children are so natural, sincere and emotional and grow way up too fast.

To capture the emotions, spirit and warmth of your family, I will spend as much time as it takes to get beautiful pictures.

During the chilled-out photo shooting, I delicatly adjust to the mood of the baby or child to obtain the very best result. 

I would also be happy to publish your photo session pictures in my portfolio with your permission.

See you at the photo session!
